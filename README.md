# Frame
## Put Art in its place.

A museum browsing mobile app to provide historical context alongside gallery works. Visitors can quickly get the context of the art that surrounds them, including ideas, events, people, music, and books important at the time of the work. Museum visitors should be free to enjoy the works that surround them without the distraction of too many details on their device. If needed, details are available via links to Wikipedia.
